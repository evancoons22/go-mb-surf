# go-mb-surf
This is a project that uses public buoy data to predict the surf report in Los Angeles. I use an LSTM model to foreceast wave height, period, and direction. 

The model that was used to make these predictions can be found in **evancoons22/nbdc-buoy-data**. 

Check out the predictions [here](https://go-ml-surf-forecast.onrender.com/).
